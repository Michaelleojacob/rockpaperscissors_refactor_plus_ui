## This project is a continuation of The_Odin_Project curriculum.

# This project was an exercise in DOM manipulation.

# Technologies used:

- Html5
- Css
- Javascript

# Struggles faced:

> First time using forEach and addEventListeners

> Taking the game logic from console to DOM elements was difficult. I had a very hard time starting the game without prompt(). Initially I was just not planning well. But eventually I came to a solution that got me results, and got the game flowing as it should.

> Splash Screen using a z-index trick.

> Refactoring the code, the logic, and how and when things are called.
